# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## Analysing The Olympics
## Project Overview

In this project, we Will be Doing  data visualization and data cleaning using Microsoft Power BI and also cover DAX, the M language, the Power Query editor, and visualization.

In this project, we will gain an understanding of:

How to import data into Power BI
How to transform and clean data using Power Query and the M language
How to model relations
How to calculate columns using DAX
## Code

You can find the Power BI report here.

File overview:

[Olympics.pbix]


## Data


* athlete_events.csv - contains information on athletes who competed in the Olympics.
* noc_regions.csv - contains information on how national olympic committee codes map to country names.
* country_population.csv - contains information on the population of each country.
* The Olympic and NOC data is originally from Kaggle. The population data is from the World Bank.

## Steps

* Data exploration - load the data in and explore it by creating visualizations
* Importing NOC data - load in information matching NOC codes to the actual country name. We'll then model the relationship.
* in medal columns - use Power Query editor to add some additional columns with medal information.
* Creating a filled map - create a map that shows the number of medals each country earned.
* Creating an animated map - make a map that shows how Olympic participation changed over time.
* Combine population data - load in population data and match it to our existing data.
* Create rolling medal counts - show a rolling total of medals earned by country.
